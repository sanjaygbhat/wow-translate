## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Download

**[⬇️ Download Latest Release](../../releases/latest)**

The download includes everything: DLL + Addon in one package.

### 2. Install

Extract and copy to your WoW folder:

```
YourWoWFolder/
├── WoW.exe
├── WoWTranslate.dll        ← From the download
├── dlls.txt                ← Add "WoWTranslate.dll" to this file
└── Interface/
    └── AddOns/
        └── WoWTranslate/   ← From the download
```

> **Note:** If `dlls.txt` doesn't exist, create it and add `WoWTranslate.dll` on the first line.

### 3. Get API Key

API keys are distributed by the addon author. Each key comes with credits for translation.

### 4. Configure In-Game

```
/wt key WT-XXXX-XXXX        Set your API key
```

**Done!** A minimap button (scroll icon) appears — click it to open settings. Chat messages will now appear translated.

## 🔧 How It Works

```
┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐    ┌─────────────┐
│  Glossary   │ →  │    Cache    │ →  │  Translate  │
│  (instant)  │    │   (free)    │    │  (credits)  │
└─────────────┘    └─────────────┘    └─────────────┘
```

1. **Glossary** — WoW terms translated instantly (raids, bosses, slang)
2. **Cache** — Seen before? Instant and free
3. **API** — New text uses credits

---

## 🎮 Language Settings

Open settings with `/wt show`:

- **Incoming**: What language to translate FROM (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Russian)
- **Outgoing**: Enable translation for Say, Party, Guild, Whisper, etc.
- **Channel Filtering**: Toggle individual channels (Say, Yell, Whisper, Party, Guild, Raid, Battleground, World/Local) for both incoming and outgoing
- **AFK Pause**: Translation pauses while AFK to save credits (on by default, configurable)

## ❓ Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| DLL not loading | Ensure `WoWTranslate.dll` is next to `WoW.exe` and listed in `dlls.txt` |
| "Out of credits" | Your API key needs more credits — contact whoever provided your key |
| No translations | Run `/wt status` to check DLL loaded, then `/wt test 你好` |
| Launcher issues | Run `WoW.exe` directly instead of through a launcher |
